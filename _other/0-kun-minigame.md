K.U.N. is a 2D adventure game set in a distant future when the entire earth is flooded with water. Waking up in the middle of this apocalyptic world, the player has to find out what happened by exploring the surroundings, and to figure out what to do next under such a critical condition.

This project was built for "MINIGAME", a gamejam by NetEase in 2018, where we entered the final round with 10 teams out of 200. This game was developed in collaboration with Sam Hu, Tina Zong, Sunny Pu, Wendy Wang, Sam Xu.
