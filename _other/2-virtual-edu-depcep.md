This project was done as a part of the Detroit Area Pre-college Engineering Program (DAPCEP), which tries to provide educational opportunities for pre-college students. I was responsible for developing an educational Virtual Manufacturing Space in VR with OpenXR and Unity for middle school students to assemble simulated manufacture lines and learn basic manufacturing concepts. The project was presented at DAPCEP 2020 and DAPCEP 2021 (held remotely), in the form of virtual reality and WebGL, respectively.
