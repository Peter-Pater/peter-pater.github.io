This thesis project focuses on enabling telepresence communication by streaming 3D figures reconstructed with 3D point clouds. The main contribution of this project is a pipeline for constructing 3D images from depth cameras mounted to the frame of a desktop. The pipeline is assembled with methods including key-point selection (e.g. SIFT), feature description (e.g. FPFH), and registration refinement (e.g. Iterative Closest Points). With an experimental 3D registration pipeline, we evaluated our system by conducting experiments under different scenes with different test users. Our pipeline is about to configure efficiently (under 10 seconds) and yields satisfactory results.
