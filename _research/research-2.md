<!-- Real-time communication with immersive 360-degree video can enable users to be telepresent within a remotely streamed environment. However, streaming high-quality 360-degree live video poses challenges for network bandwidth, which is exacerbated on mobile connections such as 4G and 5G cellular connections. To reduce bandwidth requirements, videos can be compressed using viewport-adaptive streaming or foveated rendering techniques. Existing work in this area has focused on video streaming applications rather than real-time communication. For live video streaming, such techniques require very low latency in order to be effective. In this work, we demonstrate an end-to-end virtual reality telepresence system which streams 6K 360-degree video over 5G millimeter-wave (mmW) radio. Our use of 5G technologies, in conjunction with mobile edge compute nodes, substantially reduces latency when compared with existing 4G networks, enabling high-efficiency foveated compression over modern cellular networks. We performed technical evaluation of our system's peak signal-to-noise (PSNR) compression loss and a user study to evaluate user's sensitivity to compressed video. Our findings demonstrate that our system achieves visually indistinguishable video streams while using 65% less data when compared with un-foveated video. We demonstrate our video compression system in the context of an immersive, telepresent video calling application. -->

This project enables telepresence communication in virtual reality. We captured a real-time 6K 360 video and streamed it with 5G connection to a virtual reality headset, employed foveated compression additional to the common H.264 to save bandwidth, investigated how much foveated compression improves the in field-of-view (FoV) bitrates by measuring the Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (PSNR) in the VR headsetâ€™s field-of-view (FoV) as well as conducting a Just-Noticeable-Difference (JND) user test on the visual quality, evaluated the implication of using a low-latency network on head-foveated high-resolution video streaming by conducting another JND user test on the video artifacts at the peripheral of the VR FoV, our results suggest that our head-foveated rendering can save video bitrates up to 65% and the low-latency brought by 5G can reduce the necessity for viewport prediction.
