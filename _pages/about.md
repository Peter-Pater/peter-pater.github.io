I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) supervised by Dr. [Robert Xiao](https://www.robertxiao.ca/). My research interests are in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). My current research focuses on bridging the physical and virtual worlds in remote AR/VR collaboration. To do so, I enable and evaluate novel interactive techniques in Mixed Reality by combining state-of-the-art technologies from computer vision and sensing. So far, I have explored sharing physical surfaces and creating virtual replicas for remote MR collaboration, and 360&deg; Video VR telepresence with 5G millimeter-wave and edge computing. Recently, I am trying to enhance the immersion, reality, and interactivity of 
mixed-reality remote collaboration with emerging machine learning technologies such as Neural Radiance Field, 
3D diffusion, and LLMs. Before UBC, I received my M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering at [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), where I worked with Dr. [Nikola Banovic](http://www.nikolabanovic.net/) and Dr. [Alanson Sample](https://www.alansonsample.com/) to track assembly tasks (e.g., Lego, furniture) with UHF-RFID sensing and Bayesian inference. Before that, I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science and B.S. in Interactive Media Arts from [New York University Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/). During my leisure time, I enjoy playing guitar and tennis.
