I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">University of British Columbia</a> supervised by Dr. <a href="https://www.robertxiao.ca/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">Robert Xiao</a>. My research interests are in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). My current research focuses on bridging the physical and virtual worlds in remote AR/VR collaboration. From sharing a slice of physical surfaces to fully immersive environments, I hope my endeavor will make future telepresence and remote collaboration more seamless and natural. My research along this path has led to publications to IMWUT, TVCG, and UIST (please see <a href="/publications" style="text-decoration:none">publications</a> for details). Before UBC, I received my M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering at <a href="https://umich.edu/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">University of Michigan</a>, where I worked with Dr. <a href="http://www.nikolabanovic.net/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">Nikola Banovic</a> and Dr. <a href="https://www.alansonsample.com/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">Alanson Sample</a> to track assembly tasks (e.g., Lego, furniture). Before that, I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science and B.S. in Interactive Media Arts from <a href="https://shanghai.nyu.edu/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">New York University Shanghai</a>. During my leisure time, I enjoy playing guitar and tennis.
